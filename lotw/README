Before I uploaded my logs into the DCL, there where 59 records from the 2000
and 2002 XMAS contests. Since I lost some XMAS contest logs, I worked on
importing these into my database, only to later realize that I'm only missing
the 2003, 2005, and 2006 logs.

Still, crosschecking the logs was interesting. At the very least I didn't miss
any QSOs submitted by other OMs.

adif.py is from pyqso, but with DARC_DOK added as valid field name.
